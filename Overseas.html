  I would like to go to New York to experience the big city life. I like exploring new cities, so I would like to stay in Manhattan and walk/bus/subway around the different parts of New York. I find the buildings and the history in New York facinatating. I would also like to visit Square Times and look around at all the billboards. Of Course while im there I love to see a Broadway show.
